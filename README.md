## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

My biggest challenge while developing this android application was thinking about how to implement all the requirements together. An example would be with the reset button, realizing that the reset would need to undo everything that the original button had done was not planned until I got to the point of actually creating the button. In general I think the most difficult part was planning how the app would be coded in the main activity section. Another example would be the counter originally I had not had a counter but realizing that a counter was the best way I have used that in my final design.
